  <ol>
    <li>
      Registering an integration with Cisco Spark is super easy. In <a href="https://developer.ciscospark.com/apps.html" target="blank">My Apps</a> click on the Plus Button.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the Create an Integration button and provide some basic information like your integration's name, description and logo. This information should be user-facing since that's what they'll see in the permission dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
      After successful registration you'll be taken to a different screen containing your integrations' newly created Client ID and Client Secret. The Client Secret will only be shown once so please copy and keep it safe!
    </li>
    <li>
      Set Authorized Redirect URI to: <span class="url">{{siteUrl}}_oauth/ciscospark</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      Finish by clicking "Create".
